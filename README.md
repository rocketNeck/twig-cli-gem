# Twig
Grab Ruby job postings from twitter based on distance.

What if you could see job listings from for Ruby development right from your command line? Yeah. Sounds like the work of a wizard. It's not. It's the work of a noob and I'm not sure if I can even do it yet.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'twig'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install twig

## Usage

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
